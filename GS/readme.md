# GS

Background:
• We have collected data on single-family homes that we want to analyze.
• [data_property.csv] contains a list of properties, but we are unsure of how "clean" the data is.
• While analyzing the data, if you make any assumptions, explain what they are in comments.
• When you are finished, submit the code that you have written and your output csv files, zipped into a compressed folder.

1. Write code to parse / ingest [data_property.csv].
2. Explore the data set, looking for potential errors, and clean the data set (this can be done manually by editing data_property.csv or programatically).
3. Explain your methodology from #2 (this can be done in comments in your code).
4. For each state: calculate the minimum square footage, maximum square footage, and the average age in years of all properties (age = current year - year_built).
5. Output the results to a csv file, matching the [output_example_1.csv] format.
